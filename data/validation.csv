Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.,在去年的TED发言上我介绍了LHC
And I promised to come back and give you an update  on how that machine worked.,而且我说过一定回来给大家实况更新 说说机器的运转情况
"So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,  the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --  27 kilometers in circumference.",这就是它，如果你去年没来的话 LHC是史上最大规模的科学实验 周长27公里
"Its job is to recreate the conditions  that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,  up to 600 million times a second.",用来重塑宇宙形成 十亿分之一秒时的状态 每秒制造6亿次
It's nothing if not ambitious.,非常具有野心
This is the machine below Geneva.,这就是在日内瓦地下的机械
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.,我们用这些探测器给迷你大爆炸照相
"This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --  44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.",这个是我就职的那台，ATLAS探测器 44米长，直径22米
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction  so you can see the scale.,这是ATLAS建造过程中的壮观景象 可以看出规模巨大
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.,去年9月10日我们第一次启动这一机器
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.,这是一张ATLAS照下的照片
It caused immense celebration in the control room.,当时控制室里欢呼雀跃
"It's a picture of the first beam particle  going all the way around the LHC,  colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,  and showering particles into the detector.",这是第一簇粒子的照片 一路沿着LHC转圈 如我们所计划地与LHC的一部分相撞 大量粒子在探测器内辐散
"In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th  we knew the machine worked,  which is a great triumph.",换句话说，当我们在9月10号看到这一景象时 我们知道这机器起作用了 这是个巨大的成功
"I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,  or this, when someone went onto Google  and saw the front page was like that.",我不知道是这个获得了满堂喝彩 还是这个——当人们登陆谷歌 看见首页图标是这样的时候
It means we made cultural impact  as well as scientific impact.,这表明我们的工作造成了文化冲击 这与它的科研冲击同样意义重大
"About a week later we had a problem with the machine,  related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.",但是大概一周之后我们的机器出了点故障 主要跟这些导线有关——这些金色的导线
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps  when the machine is working in full power.,这些导线传导1万3千安培电流 当机器全部启动
"Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,  ""No they don't. They're small wires.""",现在你们之中的一些工程师可能会说 “不可能，这些电线太细了”
They can do that because  when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.,它们能做到 因为当温度极低它们就成了超导导线
"So at minus 271 degrees,  colder than the space between the stars,  those wires can take that current.",所以在零下271摄氏度 低于星球间宇宙空间的温度的情况下 这些导线可以传导如此强的电流
"In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,  there was a manufacturing defect.",在LHC中九千多个电磁铁里的一个接点上 有一个安装技术失误
"So the wire heated up slightly,  and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.",于是导线温度微微升高了一点 导致它传导的1万3千安培电流忽然受到电阻
This was the result.,这就是结果
"Now that's more impressive  when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,  and they moved about a foot.",非常令人震惊 因为那些磁铁重达20吨 它们移动了大约一英尺
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.,一共大概有50个磁铁受损

"Now of course, in a way  those accidents reignite the debate  about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.",很明显现在，一方面 这些事故重新激化了关于 前沿科学和工程学的辩论，但这些很容易被反驳
"I think that the fact that it's so difficult,  the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.",我认为这任务过于艰难却仍令 我们执着追求的事实本身，就是LHC的价值所在
"I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,  who, I suspect,  when defending his protege's useless experiments --  his protege was Michael Faraday --  said this, ""Nothing is so dangerous  to the progress of the human mind  than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,  that there are no mysteries in nature,  that our triumphs are complete, and that  there are no new worlds to conquer.""",最后我愿复述一位英国科学家戴维翰弗瑞的话 我记得他 在为自己学徒无意义的实验辩护时 ——他的学徒是迈克尔法拉第—— 说过：对于人类头脑发展来说 没有什么比这想法更为危险： 认为我们已经理解了科学之所有 一切谜团尽已揭开 人类已经大获全胜 而停止对新知的探索
Thank you.,谢谢
"I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,  playing with blocks.",首先，我想请大家回忆一下你们在孩提时代 玩过的积木。
"As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,  pick them up and move them around,  you were actually learning how to think and solve problems  by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.",当你构思着怎么去搭建积木 并且去动手操作的时候， 其实是你正在学习怎样思考和解决问题。 这即是对物体的空间结构的理解和感知。
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected  to how we understand a lot of the world around us.,理解物体的空间结构非常有助于 我们对很多周围事物的学习。
"So, as a computer scientist  inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --  along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --  I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip  moving around a flat desktop,  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,",因此，作为一个计算机领域的科学家， 在这种手动思考方式的启发下， 以及在我的导师Pattie和我的合作伙伴Jeevan Kalanithi的帮助下， 我开始思考--要是我们能用一种新型计算机 来代替鼠标移动光标，就好比一种数字化的手指尖 在桌面移动--那样会如何呢？ 要是我们能用手来直接感知信息，
arranging it the way we wanted?,按我们的思路来组合信息--那样会如何呢？
"This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,  by building Siftables.",这样的疑问不断萦绕在我的脑海中，于是我们决定去探寻答案， 所以才有了这款Siftables。
"In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer  the size of a cookie.",简单地说，Siftable是一款互动计算机， 体积如饼干般大小。
"They're able to be moved around by hand,  they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,  and they have a screen and a wireless radio.",Siftables可以用手随意移动， 每块Siftable可以互相感知彼此的移动， 每块Siftable还有显示屏和无线电装置。
"Most importantly, they're physical,  so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.",最重要的是，每块Siftable都是独立的， 就像积木一样，可以随意搭配。
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem  of tools for manipulating digital information.,而且Siftables代表了一种新的生态系统 --即数字化信息的操作工具。
"And as these tools become more physical,  more aware of their motion, aware of each other,  and aware of the nuance of how we move them,  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.",这种操作工具更加独立， 更加灵敏，能彼此感知， 感知任何细微的移动， 所以我们可以使用这种工具尝试一些新的有趣的互动。
"So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.",现在，我就来演示一些简单的。
"This Siftable is configured to show video,  and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.",这块Siftable有映像配置， 如果我把它向一侧倾斜，那么它所显示的画面也朝这边倾斜， 如果我把它朝反方向倾斜，那么图像也朝反方向倾斜。
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.,而且这些Siftables能互相感知。
"So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.",如果把它们一个挨一个摆好，有趣的现象就会发生。
"If they get surrounded, they notice that too,  they might get a little flustered.",如果把它们随意一堆，他们也会察觉到， 那就会有点儿混乱。
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.,它们还能感知彼此的移动和倾斜。
"One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,  was that we could use everyday gestures on data,  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.",我们发现一个有趣的互动-- 我们可以通过一些常用的手势和Siftables进行互动， 比如象倒液体那样把颜色从一块Siftable倒入另一块Siftable.
"So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets  and I can use them to pour color into that central one,  where they get mixed.","我们来看这个演示，这有三块设置成油漆桶模式的Siftables, 我们可以把这些桶里的颜色倒入中间的那个， 把颜色混在一起."
"If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.",如果倒多了，可以再倒回去一些。
"There are also some neat possibilities for education,  like language, math and logic games  where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,  and view the results immediately.",Siftables还有学习机的功能， 可以用来学语言、算算术等-- 我们希望通过这些功能让学习变得快捷， 更快看到结果。
So here I'm --    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.,这也是我来这里展示Siftables的原因--  这是我用一个简单方程式做成的斐波那契数列。
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.,Siftables还可以玩拼字游戏--一种Scrabble和Boggle混搭的拼字游戏。
"Basically, in every round  you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.","这种拼字游戏的玩法大致如下， 你随意拿一块带有字母的Siftable, 当你把几块带有字母的Siftables拼在一起组成单词时，Siftables会在字典里自动查找单词。"
"Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.",大约30秒后Siftables会自动根据正确的单词拼写顺序改变原来显示的字母，组成正确的单词， 你还可以尝试用其他的字母拼出新的单词。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。
"So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,  and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.",现在，屏幕上显示的是一些孩子正在Media Lab 里参与Siftables的试用体验， 我把孩子们的体验过程拍了下来。
They really loved it.,孩子们非常喜欢Siftables。
"And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application  is that you don't have to give people many instructions.",而且有趣的是在玩这个拼字游戏的时候 我们并不需要向他们解释什么。
"All you have to say is, ""Make words,""  and they know exactly what to do.",只要跟他们说这是个“拼字”游戏时， 他们就知道该怎么做了。
So here's another few people trying it out.,现在屏幕上显示的是另一些人在体验Siftables。
"That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.",右下角这位是年龄最小的体验者。
"Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.",他只是想把Siftables堆在一起。
"So to him, they were just blocks.",在他看来，Siftables只是积木。
"Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.",现在屏幕上显示的是一种动画功能的互动尝试。
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.,我们希望Siftables能成为学习语言的帮手。
"And this is Felix, actually.",画面上的这个孩子叫Felix。
"And he can bring new characters into the scene,  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.",他能把一些新元素添加到动画图像上， 他所做的就是把桌上的Siftables拿起来朝着动画图像投一下影，就可以把这些新元素加到动画上了。
"Here, he's bringing the sun out.",看，他把太阳加上去了。
Video: The sun is rising.,视频：太阳升起来了。
David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.,大卫·梅若：现在他把拖拉机加上去了。
Video: The orange tractor.,视频：橙色的拖拉机。
Good job! Yeah!,做的不错！
DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other  he can make the characters interact --  Video: Woof!,把Siftables朝动画图像晃一下就可以把新元素加到画面上 他把新元素加上去了-- 视频：狗吠声
DM: inventing his own narrative.,梅若：他在编写属于他的动画故事。
Video: Hello!,视频：你好！
"DM: It's an open-ended story,  and he gets to decide how it unfolds.",梅若：这是个开放式结局的故事， 他在计划怎样展开故事情节。.
"Video: Fly away, cat.",视频：猫坐着热气球飞走了。
"DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today  is a music sequencing and live performance tool  that we've built recently,  in which Siftables act as sounds  like lead, bass and drums.",梅若：下面我要给大家进行最后一个展示 这个功能可以编排、演奏音乐 是我们最近研发的， Siftables的这种功能体现在声音方面， 能发出像超载音、贝斯及鼓的声音。
"Each of these has four different variations,  you get to choose which one you want to use.",每个模块有四档可供调节， 任君选择。
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence  that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.,你可以把声音模块的Siftable里的声音加入编辑模块的Siftable 按你喜欢的方式。 加入声音只需把声音模块靠近编辑模块。
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.,还有类似混响器、滤声器作用的Siftable模块。
"There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.",把这类模块靠近声音模块就可以调整声音了。
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.,接下来，可以用控制总体节奏和音量的Siftable模块
"And then, overall effects like tempo and volume  So let's have a look.",靠近编辑模块的Siftable来调整节奏和音量。 我们来看一下。
"Video:   DM: We'll start by putting a lead  into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,  extend it, add a little more lead.",视频： 梅若：开始先把超载音 注入两个编辑模块， 再加一些超载音。
Now I put a bass line in.,现在加入贝斯音。
Video:   DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.,视频： 梅若：现在加入一些打击乐器的声音。
"Video:   DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.",视频： 梅若：现在把滤声模块靠近鼓声模块，这样可以调整声音。
Video:   DM: I can speed up the whole sequence  by tilting the tempo one way or the other.,视频： 梅若：我来把节奏加快些 只需把节奏模块靠近编辑模块。
Video:   DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.,视频： 梅若：现在再把滤声模块靠近贝斯模块滤声。
Video:   DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.,视频： 梅若：在音乐演奏的过程中还可以重新编排。
"So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,  making it longer or shorter as I go.",所以并不需要提前编排，而是在演奏时随时改编， 可长可短。
"And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out  using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.",最后，我来结束整个演奏， 用音量模块靠近编辑模块，用左边这个档。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。
"So, as you can see,  my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces  that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.",正如大家看到的， 我的理想就是研发一款新型的能够人机互动的媒介 更好地配合人体大脑的运作。
"And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,  and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.",今天，我在这给大家展示了Siftable， 我们的后续研究正在实验室中进行。
So the thought I want to leave you with  is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools  for interacting with digital media  that are going to bring information into our world  on our terms.,我想跟大家交流的想法就是 我们在研发新一代尖端科技产品 --可以和数字媒体接轨的科技产品， 它将给世界带来变化 这样的革新在我们这一代就会看到。

"You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --  about the human genome and what that might mean,  and discovering new sets of genes.",在这之前我已经讨论过这些项目中的一部分 关于人类基因组和它们的意义。 以及发现新的基因组。
"We're actually starting at a new point:  we've been digitizing biology,  and now we're trying to go from that digital code  into a new phase of biology  with designing and synthesizing life.","这次我们要从一个新的角度来看： 我们在从事数字化生物学的工作。 并且现在我们正尝试从那些数字代码走向 一个生物学的全新阶段, 设计与人工合成生命。"
"So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.",我们经常试图提出一些较大的问题。
"""What is life?"" is something that I think many biologists  have been trying to understand  at various levels.",“生命是什么”我想是许多生物学家 不断地尝试在 在不同层面去理解的问题。
"We've tried various approaches,  paring it down to minimal components.",我们尝试了许多方法， 把它分解到最小的组成部分。
"We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;  when we sequenced the human genome,  it was going from the analog world of biology  into the digital world of the computer.",到目前我们几乎已经用了20年来将其数字化。 当我们在排序人类基因组的时候， 它从生物学的模拟分析世界 走进了计算机的数字世界。
"Now we're trying to ask, ""Can we regenerate life  or can we create new life  out of this digital universe?""",现在我们在尝试提问，我们是否能够再造生命， 或者我们是否从这个数字世界中 能创造新的生命?
"This is the map of a small organism,  Mycoplasma genitalium,  that has the smallest genome for a species  that can self-replicate in the laboratory,  and we've been trying to just see if  we can come up with an even smaller genome.","这是一种微生物的基因序列图, 生殖支原体, 它有着对于一个物种来说最小的基因组 能使其在实验室中自我复制。 并且我们在尝试了解是否 我们能找到一种更小的基因组。"
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes  out of the 500 or so that are here.,我们能够从500组基因中 分离出一百组就是我们眼前的这些。
"When we look at its metabolic map,  it's relatively simple  compared to ours --  trust me, this is simple --  but when we look at all the genes  that we can knock out one at a time,  it's very unlikely that this would yield  a living cell.",但当我们来看它的新陈代谢的时候， 这其实是相对简单的 相对我们的来说。 相信我，这算简单的。 但当我们在看所有这些 我们能一个一个分离出的基因组的时候， 很难相信它们能产生出 一个活生生的细胞。
So we decided the only way forward  was to actually synthesize this chromosome  so we could vary the components  to ask some of these most fundamental questions.,所以，我们认为唯一能继续研究的方法 就是人工合成这些染色体 以便我们能改变它的组成部分 来继续提问这些最基本的问题。
And so we started down the road of:  can we synthesize a chromosome?,于是我们开始沿着这条路走下去 “我们能人工合成染色体吗？”
Can chemistry permit making  these really large molecules  where we've never been before?,化学原则真的允许我们制造 这些我们从未实现过的 超大分子吗？
"And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?",而且，就算我们可以，我们能激活它吗？
"A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.",一对染色体，顺便说下，只是一些无活性的化学物质。
"So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing  at an exponential pace.",我们数字化生命的速度不断地 以指数速度加快。
"Our ability to write the genetic code  has been moving pretty slowly  but has been increasing,  and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.",我们写基因编码的能力 进步地却非常慢， 不过也还是在增加的。 我们最近的状况将会把速度提升到指数曲线。
We started this over 15 years ago.,我们于15年前开始这项工作。
"It took several stages, in fact,  starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.",实际上它经过了好几个阶段。 在我们做最初的试验前，先进行了一次生物伦理学的评估。
But it turns out synthesizing DNA  is very difficult.,但结果是人工合成DNA 是非常困难的。
"There are tens of thousands of machines around the world  that make small pieces of DNA --  30 to 50 letters in length --  and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,  the more errors there are.",全世界有十几万台设备 在制造小片断的DNA， 长度在30到50个字符， 并且这是一个会倒退的过程，制造的片断越是长， 产生的错误就越是多。
So we had to create a new method  for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.,所以我们不得不创造一种新的方法 把这些小的片断排放在一起并纠正所有的错误。
"And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information  of the genome of phi X174.",这是我们的第一次尝试，从Phi X 174基因组 的数字信息开始。
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.,是一种能杀死细菌的小型病毒。
"We designed the pieces, went through our error correction  and had a DNA molecule  of about 5,000 letters.",我们设计了它的基因片断，经过了错误纠正， 就拥有了一条 5000字符长度的DNA。
"The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical  and put it in the bacteria,  and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,  made the viral particles.",最另人兴奋的阶段是当我们把这段没有活性的化学物质 放进细菌内， 细菌开始读取基因编码， 制造了病毒粒子。
The viral particles then were released from the cells  and came back and killed the E. coli.,接着细胞释放出病毒粒子， 再返回来杀死了E.coli。
I was talking to the oil industry recently  and I said they clearly understood that model.,我最近与石油行业有一些交流， 我觉得他们对这个模式理解的非常透彻。
"They laughed more than you guys are.   And so, we think this is a situation  where the software can actually build its own hardware  in a biological system.",他比你们笑的大声多了。 因此我们认为这种情况实际上 是软件能在一个生物系统内 打造自己的硬件。
"But we wanted to go much larger:  we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --  it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --  so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses  so we could actually vary the cassettes  to understand  what the actual components of a living cell are.",但我们还想再扩大规模。 我们希望制造整条细菌染色体， 一条超过580，000字符长度的基因编码。 我们认为应该在以病毒大小的“盒”中制造它们 这样我们可以改变这些“盒” 来理解 一个活的细胞的实际组成部分是什么？
"Design is critical,  and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,  that digital information has to be really accurate.",设计是非常重要的， 并且如果你在计算机上开始使用数字信息。 那这些数字信息必须十分准确。
"When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,  the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.",当我们在1995年第一次对这组基因排序时， 准确率的标准是每10000个基本对一个错误。
"We actually found, on resequencing it,  30 errors; had we used that original sequence,  it never would have been able to be booted up.",实际上我们发现，在重新排序时， 平均是30个错误。如果我们使用原先的序列， 这组基因永远不可能被启动。
Part of the design is designing pieces  that are 50 letters long  that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces  to build smaller subunits  we have to design so they can go together.,设计工作的一部分是设计 50个字符长度的片断 并和其他的50字符长的片段叠加 以构建更小的次单元。 我们要设计过他们才能聚到一起。
We design unique elements into this.,其中有我们设计过的独特部分。
You may have read that we put watermarks in.,你们可能听说过我们在其中加入了水印
"Think of this:  we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.","想想看 基因编码有四个字符：A,C,G和T。"
"Triplets of those letters  code for roughly 20 amino acids,  such that there's a single letter designation  for each of the amino acids.",这些字符的三联体 - 以及这些字符 编成了大约20种氨基酸 这样每个氨基酸就有了 一个字符标记
"So we can use the genetic code to write out words,  sentences, thoughts.",所以我们能使用基因编码来书写言语 句子，想法。
"Initially, all we did was autograph it.",最初，我们所做的就是用它来签名。
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.,有些人有点失望我们没用它来做首诗。
We designed these pieces so  we can just chew back with enzymes;  there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.,我们设计了这些片断 并能使用酶来裁切。 有些酶是用来修复他们并把他们放到一起的。
"And we started making pieces,  starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,  put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,  then put sets of those going up to 72,000.",接着我们开始制造片断， 从7000字符长度的片断开始 把他们拼在一起制造24，000字符长度的片断 再把几组片断合并，变成了72，000长的片断
"At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance  so we could sequence them  because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust  that you can see in a minute.",在每个阶段，我们大量培养了这些片断 因此我们可以给他们排序 因为我们希望创造一个异常可靠的过程 一分钟内你就将看见
We're trying to get to the point of automation.,我们试着达到自动化的层面
"So, this looks like a basketball playoff.",这看起来就像是一场篮球赛的对阵图
"When we get into these really large pieces  over 100,000 base pairs,  they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --  it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --  and so we turned to other mechanisms.",当这些非常大的片断超过 100，000基本对时 他们就很难继续在E.coil里长的更长了。 在试尽了各种现代分子生物学的工具后 我们转向其他的途径。
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination  that biology uses to repair DNA  that can put pieces together.,我们知道有个方法叫同源重组， 生物学上用来修复DNA， 它能把片断组合到一起
Here's an example of it:  there's an organism called  Deinococcus radiodurans  that can take three millions rads of radiation.,这里有一个例子 有一种微生物叫 耐辐射球菌 能够承受三百万度的辐射量。
"You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.",你能看到在顶部的视图里，它的染色体四散在各个地方
"Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it  back together exactly as it was before.",12到24小时以后，它将自己 又组合回之前的原状。
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.,我们有数千种微生物有这种能耐
These organisms can be totally desiccated;  they can live in a vacuum.,这些微生物能够完全脱离水。 他们能存活在真空中
"I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space,  move around, find a new aqueous environment.",我完全确信外层空间存在着生命， 四处移动，遇到一个新的有水的环境
"In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.",实际上，NASA已经展示过很多这样的例子。
"Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built  using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms  with the right design of the pieces we put them in;  yeast puts them together automatically.",这里有一组我们拍摄的这个分子的显微图像。 通过这些过程，其实就是前面所提到的酵母的方法 同时放入经过我们正确设计的片断。 酵母自动地将他们聚合。
This is not an electron micrograph;  this is just a regular photomicrograph.,这并不是电子显微图像； 它仅仅是普通的光学显微镜。
It's such a large molecule  we can see it with a light microscope.,这是如此之大的一个分子 我们能用一个光学显微镜观察它。
These are pictures over about a six-second period.,这些是时长约为六秒的图像。
"So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.",这是我们所公开的最近的试验成果。
"This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;  it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.",这是超过580000字符长的基因编码。 这也是由人类设定结构并制造的最大的分子。
It's over 300 million molecular weight.,它超过了3亿分子重量。
"If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,  it takes 142 pages  just to print this genetic code.",如果我们以10号字体不间隔地将其打印出来。 总共需要142页 来打印这些基因编码
"Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?",那我们该如何来启动一段染色体，我们该如何激活它?
"Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;  it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.",显然处理一个病毒非常简单 处理一个细菌就复杂多了
"into eukaryotes like ourselves:  you can just pop out the nucleus  and pop in another one,  and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.",处理像我们自身这样的 真核生物也相对简单 你能取出一个细胞核 然后塞进另一个细胞中， 这就是大家听到的关于克隆的手法
"With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,  but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant  of a chromosome from one cell to another  and activate it.",对于古细菌，它们的染色体与整个细胞连成一体， 但最近我们也明确了我们能完成一个完整的移植 将染色体从一个细胞转移到另一个细胞中 并激活它。
"We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --  roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --  we added a few extra genes  so we could select for this chromosome,  we digested it with enzymes  to kill all the proteins,  and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --  and you'll appreciate  our very sophisticated graphics here.",我们从一个种群的微生物中提取出染色体。 基本上，这两个的差别就如同人类和老鼠般。 我们加上了一些新的基因 这样我们就能选择这些染色体。 我们用酶来分解它们 去除所有的蛋白质 当我们将它放入细胞时发生的情形非常惊人 你们应该会喜欢 我们所制作的非常精密的演示图像 --
The new chromosome went into the cell.,新的染色体进入细胞。
"In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,  but we tried to design the process a little bit further.",实际上我们原以为这个过程就到此为止了。 但是我们试图将这个过程设计得更深入一些。
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.,这是一个重大的进化机制。
"We find all kinds of species  that have taken up a second chromosome  or a third one from somewhere,  adding thousands of new traits  in a second to that species.",我们发现所有接受了 第二段染色体的物种 或来自其他地方的第三方染色体， 在一秒钟内增加了 数千种新特征到其自身。
"So, people who think of evolution  as just one gene changing at a time  have missed much of biology.",原本人们所持有的在进化的过程中 每次只会有一个基因发生变化 的观念忽略了生物的许多实际情况。
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes  that actually digest DNA.,有一种酶叫做限制酶 是能够消化DNA的
The chromosome that was in the cell  doesn't have one;  the chromosome we put in does.,原先细胞中的染色体没有这种酶 没有这种酶 而当我们置入一段拥有这种酶的染色体
"It got expressed and it recognized  the other chromosome as foreign material,  chewed it up, and so we ended up  just with a cell with the new chromosome.",它表现了出来，并且辨认出 另一段染色体是外来物质， 它就将其消化，最后我们就有了 一个包含有新的DNA的细胞
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.,我们放入的基因导致它变成了蓝色。
"And with a very short period of time,  all the characteristics of one species were lost  and it converted totally into the new species  based on the new software that we put in the cell.",在非常短的一段时间里， 所有的原先物种的特征全部消失了， 并且完全转化成了一个新物种， 基于我们放入细胞的新“软件”。
"All the proteins changed,  the membranes changed;  when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.",所有的蛋白质都改变了， 细胞膜也改变了 -- 当我们读取它的基因编码，实际上就是我们植入的那种。
"So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,  but we can, by moving the software of DNA around,  change things quite dramatically.",这可能听起来像基因炼金术， 但我们的确能通过转移DNA， 来急剧地改变事物。
"Now I've argued, this is not genesis;  this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution.",现在，我要声明这不是创世纪 -- 这是建立在35亿年的进化上的
"And I've argued that we're about to perhaps  create a new version of the Cambrian explosion,  where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design.",并且我认为我们可能 会创造新一版的寒武纪生命大爆发 出现大量基于这种数字化设计

I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.,我认为出于一些需求我们这样做的原因是非常明显的。
We're about to go from six and a half  to nine billion people over the next 40 years.,我们的人口将在接下来的40年中从 65亿变成90亿
To put it in context for myself:  I was born in 1946.,以我自己的例子来说 我出生于1946年
"There are now three people on the planet  for every one of us that existed in 1946;  within 40 years, there'll be four.",现在世界上就变成了三个人 相对于我们中每一个从1946年就存在的人； 在接下来的四十年内，就变成了四个。
"We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,  medicines, fuel  for the six and a half billion.",我们在为65亿人提供食物，洁净的淡水， 医药，燃料上 都十分困难。
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.,换作90亿人那真是捉襟见肘了。
"We use over five billion tons of coal,  30 billion-plus barrels of oil --  that's a hundred million barrels a day.",我们使用超过50亿顿的煤， 300多亿桶的石油。 也就是每天一千万桶。

"We now, from our discovery around the world,  have a database with about 20 million genes,  and I like to think of these as the design components of the future.",我们现在从全球各地的发现 有了一个包含约两千万组基因的数据库， 并且我乐于把它们看作是未来的设计组件。
"The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components,  and look at the diversity that came out of that.",电气行业只有十来种组件， 再看看从中能得到的多样性。
We're limited here primarily  by a biological reality  and our imagination.,目前我们主要的限制来自于 生物学的现实情况 以及我们的想像力。
"We now have techniques,  because of these rapid methods of synthesis,  to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics.",我们现在拥有这样的技术， 是因为这些能制造我们称之为“混合染色体组”的 快速的人工合成方法。
We have the ability now to build a large robot  that can make a million chromosomes a day.,我们现在所拥有的制造一个大型机器人的能力 能让我们每天制造一百万个染色体。

"And it's just standard selection:  we can select for viability,  chemical or fuel production,  vaccine production, etc.",并且这只是标准选择。 我们可以以生存能力来选择， 化学或燃料生产， 疫苗生产等等。
This is a screen snapshot  of some true design software  that we're working on to actually be able to sit down  and design species in the computer.,这是一张屏幕截图 截取的是一些我们 实际坐下来工作时在电脑中 真正用来设计物种的设计软件。
"You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like:  we know exactly what their genetic code looks like.",我们并不一定要知道它看起来是怎样。 我们确切地知道它们的基因编码究竟是什么样的。
We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels.,我们目前把注意力放在“第四代燃料”上。
"You've seen recently, corn to ethanol  is just a bad experiment.",你们最近看到了将谷物转化成乙醇 只是一个糟糕的试验。
"We have second- and third-generation fuels  that will be coming out relatively soon  that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels  like octane or different types of butanol.",很快我们将会拥有 第二及第三代燃料。 就是糖转化成更高价值的燃料 例如辛烷或不同种类的丁醇。
"But the only way we think that biology  can have a major impact without  further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability  is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,  and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.",但我们认为生物学唯一能 产生一个巨大影响的同时又不 增加食物的支出与限制其可利用性的方法 是在于我们是否能开始用二氧化碳作为它的原料。 所以我们正在进行设计新的细胞能朝这条路发展下去。
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels  in about 18 months.,并且我们认为在18个月里我们会取得 第一份第四代燃料。
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...,阳光和二氧化碳是其中一个方法 --
"but in our discovery around the world,  we have all kinds of other methods.",-- 但我们从全世界各地的发现中， 我们还有许多种其他方法。
This is an organism we described in 1996.,"这是一种微生物,1996年被记载"
"It lives in the deep ocean,  about a mile and a half deep,  almost at boiling-water temperatures.",它生活在深海。 大约1.5英里深， 几乎是在沸腾的水温中。
It takes CO2 to methane  using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.,它将二氧化碳转化成甲烷 使用氢分子最为它的能量来源。
"We're looking to see if we can take  captured CO2,  which can easily be piped to sites,  convert that CO2 back into fuel  to drive this process.","我们在看是否能把 收集到的二氧化染, ，它们非常方便就能被引进处理站， 转化成燃料， 来驱动这个过程。"
"So, in a short period of time,  we think that we might be able to increase  what the basic question is of ""What is life?""","因此在很短的时间内， 我们觉得我们或许可以增加对于""生命是什么?"" 的基本问题的理解。"
"We truly, you know,  have modest goals  of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry --     Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? --    become a major source of energy ...","我们的确 有着替换整个 石油化工行业的小小目标。  如果你不能在TED做到这些,哪里还有可能呢?  成为一项主要的能源。"
"But also, we're now working on using these same tools  to come up with instant sets of vaccines.",并且我们也在使用同样的工具 制造了几组即时疫苗。
You've seen this year with flu;  we're always a year behind and a dollar short  when it comes to the right vaccine.,你们都看到今年出现的流感， 我们总是要慢上一年的时间并且在缺乏资金的情况下 才等到有用的疫苗。

We're a ways away from improving people:  our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance  to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.,我们正在一条离改善人类生活越来越远的路上。 我们的目标就是确保我们能有机会活到 足够长的时间或许就能做到这件事了。非常感谢大家。
"What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can,  is some foundational work, some new technology  that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago.",首先，我要用最快的速度为大家演示 一些新技术的基础研究成果。 正好是一年前，微软收购了我们公司，
"This is Seadragon, and it's an environment  in which you can either locally or remotely interact  with vast amounts of visual data.",而我们为微软带来了这项技术，它就是Seadragon。 Seadragon是一个软件环境，你可以通过它以近景或远景的方式 浏览浩瀚的可视化数据。
"We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here  and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in,  panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want.",我们这里看到的是许多许多GB级别的数码照片， 对它们可以进行持续并且平滑的放大， 可以通过全景的方式浏览它们，还可以对它们进行重新排列。
"And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at,  how big these collections are or how big the images are.",不管所见到的数据有多少、 图像集有多大以及图像本身有多大，Seadragon都拥有这样的处理能力。
"Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos,  but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress,  and it's in the 300 megapixel range.",以上展示的图片大部分都是由数码相机拍摄的照片， 但这个例子则不同，它是一张来自国会图书馆的扫描图片， 拥有3亿个像素。
It doesn't make any difference  because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one  is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment.,然而，浏览它并没有什么区别， 因为限制系统性能的唯一因素只是： 你所使用的屏幕的像素数。
It's also very flexible architecture.,Seadragon同时也是一个非常灵活的架构。
"This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.",举个例子，这是一本完整的书，它的数据是非图像的。
"This is ""Bleak House"" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter.",这是狄更斯所著的《荒凉山庄》，一列就是一章的内容。
"To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image,  we can do something like so, to really show  that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.",我给大家证明一下这真的是文本而非图片， 我们可以这样操作， 大家可以看出这真的是文本，而不是一幅图片。
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book.,也许这会是一种阅读电子书的方式，
I wouldn't recommend it.,但是我可不推荐这么做。
"This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian.",接下来是一个更加实际的例子，这是一期《卫报》。
Every large image is the beginning of a section.,每一张大图片是一版开篇，
"And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper,  which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.",而报纸或者杂志的纸质版本本身就包含了多种比例的图片， 在阅读的时候，读者会得到更好的阅读体验， 从而享受阅读的乐趣。
We've done something  with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.,我们在这里做了小小的改动 在这一期《卫报》得角上。
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution --  much higher than in an ordinary ad --  and we've embedded extra content.,我们虚构了一个高分辨率的广告图片—— 这比你平常看到的普通广告的分辨率要高很多， 在图片中嵌入了额外的内容。
"If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.",如果你希望看到这辆车的特性，你可以看这里。
"Or other models, or even technical specifications.",你还能看到其他的型号，甚至技术规格。
And this really gets at some of these ideas  about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.,这种方式在一定程度上 避免了屏幕实际使用面积的限制。
We hope that this means no more pop-ups  and other rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary.,我们希望这个技术能够减少不必要的弹出窗口 以及类似的垃圾信息。
"Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications  for a technology like this.",显然，对于这项技术的应用， 数字地图也是显而易见的应用之一。
"And this one I really won't spend any time on,  except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.",对此，我真的不想花费太多的时间进行介绍， 我只想告诉大家我们已经对这个领域做出了自己的贡献。
But those are all the roads in the U.S.,这些只是在NASA的地理空间图片基础上
superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image.,进行叠加处理而得到的美国的道路地图。
"So let's pull up, now, something else.",现在，我们先放下这些，看看其他的。
This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.,实际上，这项技术已经放到网上了，大家可以自己去体验一下。
"This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies.",这个项目叫Photosynth，
"One of them is Seadragon  and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research  done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington,  co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.",它实际上融合了两个不同的技术： 一个是Seadragon， 而另一个则是源自华盛顿大学的研究生Noah Snavely 所进行的计算机视觉研究的成果。
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.,这项研究还得到了华盛顿大学Steve Seitz
A very nice collaboration.,和微软研究院Rick Szeliski的协助。这是一个非常漂亮的合作成果。
And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon.,这个项目在互联网上已经得到应用了，它是基于Seadragon技术构建的。
"You can see that when we do these sorts of views,  where we can dive through images  and have this kind of multi-resolution experience.",你可以看到，我们轻松地对图片进行多种方式的查看， 从而能够对图片进行细致的剖析 并且拥有多分辨率的浏览体验。
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful.,不过，这些图片在三维空间的排列事实上是非常有意义的。
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together  so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots --  all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken.,计算机视觉算法将这些图片联系到一起， 那么这些图片就能够将真实空间呈现出来了， 而我们正是在这个空间里拍下了上述的照片——这些照片都是在 加拿大落基山脉的格拉西湖附近拍下的——（所有照片）都是在这里拍下的。
"So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging,  and these things have all been related spatially.",因此你可以看到这里的元素是稳定的幻灯放映或者全景成像， 而这些内容在空间上都是关联的。
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.,我不确定我们是否有时间来展示更多的环境全景。
Some are much more spatial.,有很多例子比这个的空间感还要强。
"I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets --  this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer --  to show you what I think  is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology,  It's not necessarily so apparent  from looking at the environments we've put up on the website.",下面让我们来看一下去年夏天， 我们利用Noah早期的数据库之一 所Photosynth的初期模型的建立。 我认为 这可谓是我们这项技术的最抢眼之处。 这项技术不单单像我们在 网站上展示得那么简单明了。
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.,主要因为我们制作网站时，要顾及到很多法律问题。
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral  that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr.,这里是利用Flickr网站上 的图像重建的巴黎圣母院。
"You just type Notre Dame into Flickr,  and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.",你所要做的只是在Flickr网站上输入“巴黎圣母院” 然后便能看到很多图片，包括留影的游人等等。
And each of these orange cones represents an image  that was discovered to belong to this model.,所有这些橘黄颜色的锥形都代表了一张 用来建立模型的图片。
"And so these are all Flickr images,  and they've all been related spatially in this way.",这些全部是来自Flickr的图片， 被这样在空间里被串联起来。
We can just navigate in this very simple way.,接着，我们便可如此自如的进行浏览。
"You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.",（鼓掌） 说实话，我从来没想过我会最后来为微软工作
It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.,受到这样欢迎，真挺令人高兴的。
"I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras:  it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs,  quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment.",我想你们可以看出 这些图片原自很多不同的相机： 从手机摄像头到专业单反。 如此大量的不同质量的照片，全被在这个环境下 拼合在了一起
"If I can find some of the sort of weird ones --  So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.",让我来找些比较诡异的图片。 看，不少照片包含了游客的大头照等等。
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go.,我记得这儿应该有 一个系列的照片 - 啊，在这儿。
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly.,这个是巴黎圣母院的海报。
We can dive in from the poster  to a physical view of this environment.,我们可以钻到海报里 去看整个重建的环境。
What the point here really is  is that we can do things with the social environment.,这里的重点呢便是我们可以 有效地利用网络社区。我们可以从每个人那里得到数据
"This is now taking data from everybody --  from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like --  and link all of that together.",将每个人对不同环境 的记忆收集在一起， 共建成模型。
"Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent  that's greater than the sum of the parts.",当所有这些图片交织在一起时， 所衍生出的 要远远超过单单收集起全部。
You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth.,这个模型所衍生出的，是整个地球。
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.,这如同是Stephen Lawler的《虚拟地球》的长尾市场。
"And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it,  and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it.",这类模型，会随着人们的 使用而不断变的复杂， 变得更加有价值。
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered.,用户的照片，会被大家 注上标签。
"If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints  and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral  suddenly gets enriched with all of that data,  and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space,  into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos,  and do a kind of a cross-modal  and cross-user social experience that way.",如果有人愿意为所有这些圣母院里的圣贤注上标签， 表明他们是谁，那我们的圣母院照片便会 一下子丰富起来， 然后呢，我们便能以这张照片为起点，进入这个空间， 这个由很多人的照片所搭建的虚拟世界， 从而得到一种跨越模型， 跨越用户的交互体验。
"And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models  of every interesting part of the Earth,  collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images  and so on, but from the collective memory.",当然了，这一切所带来另外一个宝贵产物便是 一个非常丰富的模型 - 充斥 这地球每个角落里有趣的景观。这些景观不再 局限于航空和卫星图片， 而是实实在在的人们按下快门一刻所收藏的记忆的集合。
Thank you so much.,非常感谢！
"Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow,  is that at some point, really within the next few years,  all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world  are going to link together?",Chris Anderson: 如果我理解正确的话，你们的这个软件将能够 在未来的几年内 将来自全球的图片 接合在一起？
"BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering,  creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images.",BAA:是的。这个软件的真正意义便是去探索。 它在图片间构建起超链接。 这个接合的过程
It's doing that based on the content inside the images.,完全是基于图片的内容。
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness  of the semantic information a lot of images have.,更令人兴奋的 在于图片所包含的大量文字语义信息。
"Like when you do a web search for images,  you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information  about what that picture is of.",比如，你在网上所以一张图片， 键入关键词后，网页上的文字内容 将包含大量与这个图片相关的信息。
What if that picture links to all of your pictures?,现在，假设这些图片全都与你的图片相连，那将会怎样？
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness  that comes out of that is really huge.,那时，所以这些语义信息的相互链接 以及内容量将是
It's a classic network effect.,巨大的。这将是非常典型的网络效应。
CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations.,CA:Blaise，太难以置信了。祝贺你们！ BAA:非常感谢各位！
"You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel  and one of the delights of ethnographic research  is the opportunity to live amongst those  who have not forgotten the old ways,  who still feel their past in the wind,  touch it in stones polished by rain,  taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.",对我来说 在世界各地旅行 和从事人类学研究的生涯中 最大的乐趣之一莫过于 体验那些没有忘记传统的族群的生活 沐浴在微风中 触摸被雨水冲洗得晶莹光亮的石头 尝着苦叶的味道 你能感受到他们的历史
"Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,  or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,  or that in the Himalaya,  the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,  is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,  and that is the idea that the world in which we live  does not exist in some absolute sense,  but is just one model of reality,",在萨满教的传说中 老虎要跨越银河 因纽特老人的神话仍然引起后人的共鸣 或者在喜马拉雅山 佛教徒还在追随法门 这让我们想起人类学的核心揭示 它的思想要义是 我们生活的世界 不是存在于一个绝对的意识之中 而只是一个现实模型

"And you might think of this cultural web of life  as being an ethnosphere,  and you might define the ethnosphere  as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,  ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being  by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.",你可以把这种生命的文化之网 看作是一个种族圈 这个种族圈可以被定义为 一个人类自从有自我意识以来通过想像力 创造的所有思想和梦想、神话、直觉 的全部之和
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.,这个种族圈是人类的伟大遗产
It's the symbol of all that we are  and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.,它是我们的身份标志 也是我们作为具有很强的探究能力的物种的标志
"And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,  so too is the ethnosphere  -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.",如同生物圈受到严重的侵蚀一样 种族圈也面临着同样的厄运 而且 它的毁灭速度更快
"No biologists, for example, would dare suggest  that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are  on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,  in the realm of biological diversity --  scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario  in the realm of cultural diversity.",没有任何一位生物学家敢断言 50% 或更多的物种已经灭绝 或者正处在灭绝的边缘 因为真相并非如此 生物多样性的 最悲观的状况 也要远胜于 文化多样性的最乐观的状况

The young acolytes are taken away from their families  sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness  in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:  two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation  they spend in their natural mother's womb;  now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.,还只有三四岁的时候 年幼的侍僧就被带离他们的家庭 隐居在黑暗世界 的冰川上用石头彻成的小屋里待到十八岁 十八年是两个九年之和 它象征在母腹的 九月怀胎
"And for this entire time,  they are inculturated into the values of their society,  values that maintain the proposition that their prayers  and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --  or we might say the ecological -- balance.",在此期间 他们如同重新回到母腹 被灌输族群的价值观 这些价值观是维系着 信徒与宇宙之间的关系
"And at the end of this amazing initiation,  and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,  they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness  of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes  of the stunningly beautiful landscape,  suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract  is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back  and says, ""You see? It's really as I've told you.",我们可称之为生态平衡 直到他们十八岁的时候 这种神奇的洗礼结束 他们生平第一次走出小屋看到阳光 在阳光的照耀下 大地呈现出令人震撼的壮观美景 那一刻 意识突然苏醒 他们以前学到的所有抽象知识 都是在令人惊叹的荣耀中得到印证 这时 祭司走过来说 看到了吧 我以前教你的都是真的
"It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect.""",这里是多么的美丽 你要保护它
"They call themselves the ""elder brothers""  and they say we, who are the younger brothers,  are the ones responsible for destroying the world.",他们称自己为兄长 称我们为弟兄 说我们是破坏世界的人
"Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.",这种直觉的领会能力非常重要
"Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,  we either invoke Rousseau  and the old canard of the ""noble savage,""  which is an idea racist in its simplicity,  or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau  and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.",说到土族居民和原始的风土人情 我们会想到罗素 关于那个高贵的野人的古老传说 那一个理想的种族主义者 我们会想到梭罗 这些人比我们更亲近大地
"Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental  nor weakened by nostalgia.",土著人并不会多愁善感 也不会承受思乡之苦
"There's not a lot of room for either  in the malarial swamps of the Asmat  or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,  through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth  that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,  but on a far subtler intuition:  the idea that the Earth itself can only exist  because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.",在疟疾盛行的阿斯玛特湿地 在寒风刺骨的西藏 并没有多少平整的土地 但是他们依靠众人的力量 经年累月 在世上创造了流传百世的神迹 这并不是因为他们自觉地认识到这一点 而且凭借非常敏感的直觉 他们认为这个世界本身的存在 是因为人类的意识吸收了自然的精华
"Now, what does that mean?",那么 这是什么意思呢
It means that a young kid from the Andes  who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit  that will direct his or her destiny  will be a profoundly different human being  and have a different relationship to that resource  or that place than a young kid from Montana  raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock  ready to be mined.,我们可以打个比方 一位生活在安第斯山脉的小孩 大人们从小就教导他说 那里的大山是阿普神的化身 它将会指引他们的命运 他们是一类完全不同的人 他们与那里的自然环境和生养之地有着一种不同的关系 而在蒙大拿州的年轻人看来 一座大山只不过是 一堆石头 可以用来开采石矿
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.,无论那座大山是神的住所 或者仅仅是一堆矿石 这都不重要
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship  between the individual and the natural world.,重要的是 这种象征意义 阐述了人与自然之间的关系
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia  to believe those forests existed to be cut.,我在英属哥伦比亚的丛林长大 受当地人思想的影响 我认为丛林是要被砍伐的
"That made me a different human being  than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth  who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw  and the Crooked Beak of Heaven  and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,  spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.",这种想法让我与 夸基特尔部落的朋友们成为两类截然不同的人 因为他们相信 这些树木是胡克神 和天堂之眼的化身 吃人的精灵在世界的最北边 在哈马撒成人礼上 他们会与这些精灵开战
"Now, if you begin to look at the idea  that these cultures could create different realities,  you could begin to understand  some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.",如果你从这个角度来看 你就会发现 这些文化创造了不同的生活方式 你就会明白 他们与众不同的生活方式
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.,这张照片是我去年八月份在亚马逊西北地区拍摄的
"This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,  the most powerful psychoactive preparation  of the shaman's repertoire.",这是阿亚胡斯卡藤 俗称死藤 你们很多人都听说过 它是一种非常强效的精神麻醉植物 萨满教徒常用它制作迷幻药- 死藤水
"What makes ayahuasca fascinating  is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,  but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:  on the one hand, this woody liana  which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,  harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --  to take the vine alone  is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke  drift across your consciousness --  but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family",死藤水的奇妙之处 不在于它神奇的药用性 而在于它的加工方法 实际上它由两种物质组成 一方面 它是一种藤本植物 含有 β-咔啉 蓬硷 和微量的致幻成份 就拿它的藤来说 你似乎可以看到 一层蓝色的烟雾 它与一种名为九节木的咖啡属灌木的枝叶
called Psychotria viridis.,混杂在一起
"This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,  very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,  5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.",这种植物具有一种强效的色胺 它的成分与脑内的5-羟色胺的成份 非常接近
"If you've ever seen the Yanomami  blowing that snuff up their noses,  that substance they make from a different set of species  also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.",亚诺马米部落的人 也会从含有5-羟色胺的植物中 提取这种物质 并且用鼻子吸食
To have that powder blown up your nose  is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel  lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity.   It doesn't create the distortion of reality;  it creates the dissolution of reality.,如果你用鼻吸入这些粉末 你会看到光怪陆离的幻觉 处于一种非常亢奋的状态 现实在你面前不是扭曲 而是荡然无存
"In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --  who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era  with his discovery of the magic mushrooms  in Mexico in the 1930s --  I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines  as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects  there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.   But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally",事实上 我曾经与我的导师 Richard Evan Shultes 争论过 上世纪 30 年代 我的导师曾经在墨西哥 发现一种神奇的蘑菇 具有很强的迷幻效果 我曾经和他争论说 你不能把这些色胺归入 迷幻成份类别 因为当它们在你身上发挥效力的时候 你已经无法体验到迷幻的感觉 但是 这些色胺物质并不能口服
because they're denatured by an enzyme  found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.,因为它们会被 人体器官中的一种名为单胺氧化酶的酶改变活性
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction  with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.,要口服这些色胺物质 还有必须同时口服改变单胺氧化酶的活性的其他化学物质
"Now, the fascinating things  are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana  are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary  to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.",有意思的是 这种藤本植物中存在的 β-咔啉 正好能够抑制单胺氧化酶 而发挥色胺的效力 因此 你不由得要问自己
"How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,  do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants  that when combined in this way,  created a kind of biochemical version  of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?",在这片丛林中 有 80:00 种植物 那里的人们是如何发现这两种在形态上毫无关联的植物 组合在一起 会发挥这种神奇的效力 这如同一种生化实验 多种成分产生的化学效应大于各成分的效力之和
"Well, we use that great euphemism, ""trial and error,""  which is exposed to be meaningless.",我们普通人会做各种各样的实验 不断地犯错误 结果却一无所获
"But you ask the Indians, and they say, ""The plants talk to us.""",但是 如果你问印第安人 他们会说 植物会说话
"Well, what does that mean?",那是什么意思呢
"This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,  all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,  all of which are referable to our eye as one species.",科凡部落的人发现了 17 种死藤 全部是他们在丛林深处发现的 在我们看来 它们是不同的物种
"And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy  and they say, ""I thought you knew something about plants.",如果你问他们是如何给这些植物分门别类的 他们说 我想你对植物有一些研究
"I mean, don't you know anything?"" And I said, ""No.""",你是不是对植物有一定的了解 我说 不是
"Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties  in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.",那我告诉你 他们说道 如果在月圆之夜 这 17 种植物的每一种植物 会用不同的密语向你歌唱
"Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,  but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens.   Now --   --  the problem -- the problem is that even those of us  sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people  view them as quaint and colorful  but somehow reduced to the margins of history  as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.",这个发现不会让你得到哈佛大学的博士学位 但是它远比会计报表更有乐趣 现在 （鼓掌） 我们面临这样一个问题 虽然我们中的一些人同情土著人的遭遇 认为他们离群索居 生活丰富多彩 但是随着我们的世界向前发展 这些人退居到历史的边缘地位
"Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,  is not going to be remembered for its wars  or its technological innovations,  but rather as the era in which we stood by  and either actively endorsed or passively accepted  the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity  on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.",对于 20 世纪 以及今后的 300 年 后人所记住的 不会这期间发生的战争 或者它的科技创新 而会记住 在我们这个时代 积极地对地球上的生态和文化多样性 进行大规模的破坏 或者被动地接受这个局面 现在 局面依然没有改变
All cultures through all time  have constantly been engaged in a dance  with new possibilities of life.,所有的文化 一直受到新的生活方式 的强烈冲击
And the problem is not technology itself.,这个问题并不在于技术本身
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux  when they gave up the bow and arrow  any more than an American stopped being an American  when he gave up the horse and buggy.,苏族印第安人即使放下弓箭 仍然还是苏族印第安人 而美国人告别骑马和坐马车的生活 依然还是美国人
"It's not change or technology  that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,  the crude face of domination.",威胁种族圈完整性的 不是变革或技术创新本身 而是权力 是野蛮的排他主义
"Wherever you look around the world,  you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;  these are dynamic living peoples  being driven out of existence by identifiable forces  that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:  whether it's the egregious deforestation  in the homeland of the Penan --  a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --  a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,",观察我们周围的世界 你就会发现 没有一种文化是注定要消亡的 这些原本富有生机活力的人群 被强暴的力量驱逐出他们的生养之地 让他们感到无所适从 无论是伯南腹地 肆无忌惮的森林砍伐 还是东南亚的撒拉瓦克游民部落 他们上代人还自由自在地生活在丛林中
"and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution  on the banks of the rivers,  where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt  that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away  to the South China Sea,  where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon  ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --  or, in the case of the Yanomami,",而现在全部已经沦落为仆役和妓女 在河岸边 你可以看到河水泥沙很重 似乎要把婆罗族的一半居住地冲走到 南中国海 在那里 日本的人货船已经整装待发 准备运走从森林砍伐的圆木 我们再来看亚诺马米部落
"it's the disease entities that have come in,  in the wake of the discovery of gold.",在那里 由于发现了金矿 人们蜂拥而至
"Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,  where I'm doing a lot of research recently,  you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.",我们再来看看西藏山区 最近我在那里做了大量的研究 在那里 你会看到政治独裁的残酷压迫
"You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people  is universally condemned, but ethnocide,  the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,  it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy.",虽然种族灭绝 在全世界受到一致的谴责 但是种族文化灭绝 也就是破坏人们的生活方式的行径 却没有受到谴责 在很多地方 它甚至被视为发展战略的一部分
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet  until you move through it at the ground level.,受到赞扬 只要你亲自去那里 你才能体会到西藏承受的痛楚 我和一位年轻的同事 从中国西北部的成都市出发
"I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China  overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa  with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa  that I understood the face behind the statistics  you hear about:  6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,  1.2 million people killed by the cadres  during the Cultural Revolution.",经过 6:00 英里的旅程 穿过西藏的东南地区 到达拉萨 当我到达拉萨的时候 才真正明白 你们所听说过的那些统计数字 背后隐藏的真相 在文化大革命期间 6:00 座神殿庙宇被拆毁 120 万人被共产党骨干分子杀害 这位年轻人的父亲皈依班禅喇嘛 中国人入侵后

"Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,  that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards  this blandly amorphous generic world view  not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination  reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,  but that we would wake from a dream one day  having forgotten there were even other possibilities.",伟大的人类学家 Margaret Mead 在生前曾经说过 她最担心的事情是 由于我们已经走进 这种无形的原生世界观 我们不仅会看到 人类的想像力 陷入更陕隘的思维圈子 而且某一天 我们一觉醒来 会忘记这个世界还有其他的可能性

"But I want to start with what I call the ""official dogma.""",我想从一个公认的信条讲起。
The official dogma of what?,什么样的公认的信条呢？
The official dogma of all Western industrial societies.,就是整个西方工业社会所笃信不疑的 一个信条。
"And the official dogma runs like this:  if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens,  the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.",这个信条是这么说的： 如果我们要想使民众获得最大限度的福利， 其方法就是使个人自由达到最大化。
"The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good,  valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human.",原因就是自由这东西在与本身就是美好的， 具有价值，为人们所必需。
"And because if people have freedom,  then each of us can act on our own  to do the things that will maximize our welfare,  and no one has to decide on our behalf.",另外，一旦人们有了自由， 我们每个人都可以自己做主 用各种办法最大限度地获得福利， 用不着别人来替我们做主。
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.,使自由达到极大化的途径就是 最大限度的增加选择性。
"The more choice people have, the more freedom they have,  and the more freedom they have,  the more welfare they have.",人们的选择越多，自由也就越多， 自由越多， 得到的福利也就越多。
"This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply  that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.",我觉得，这个观念就像掺进了我们的 自来水里那样根深蒂固 以至于没人想起来会对它提出疑问。
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives.,同样这个观念也深嵌于我们的日常生活之中。
I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.,我来给你们举些例子看看当代社会的 进步发展让我们变得有可能做些什么事。
This is my supermarket. Not such a big one.,这是我家附近的一个超市。不算很大。
I want to say just a word about salad dressing.,我只想说说这里的色拉调料。
"175 salad dressings in my supermarket,  if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils  and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy  to make a very large number of your own salad dressings,  in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.",我这家超市有175种各式色拉调料， 还没算上10种不同牌子的特级初榨橄榄油 和12种 Balsamic 葡萄醋任你选购， 如果碰巧那175种色拉酱都不和你的口味， 你就可以用它们调出另一大批 你自己的色拉酱。
So this is what the supermarket is like.,你看，这就是超级市场的样子。
"And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system --  speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier --  and in this one single consumer electronics store,  there are that many stereo systems.",然后你转身出来到一家家用电器店去配置 一套立体音响系统 - 音箱啦，CD机啦，磁带机，收音机，放大器。 就这么一家家用电器店里 立体音响系统就多得数不清。

You've got to admit that's a lot of choice.,你没法不承认这可是不小的一堆选择吧。
In other domains -- the world of communications.,换个行业，说说通讯。
"There was a time, when I was a boy,  when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,  as long as it came from Ma Bell.",我还是孩子那会儿， 你要想接通电话服务， 那就得去玛贝尔公司，只此一家。
You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.,你不用买，只需去租一架电话机回来。
"One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.",通常情况是，那电话用到死都不会坏。
And those days are gone.,那种日子早已一去不返了。
"We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,  especially in the world of cell phones.",如今我们几乎有无穷无尽的电话品种， 尤其是手机。(显示漫画）
These are cell phones of the future.,这些都是未来的手机。
"My favorite is the middle one --  the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.",其中我最津津乐道的是中间那款 - 带着MP3播放机，鼻毛剪和法式焦糖布丁的喷火枪。
"And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet,  you can rest assured that one day soon, you will.",如果你还没在你家旁边的商店里见过的话， 不必担心，用不了多久你就会看到的。
And what this does  is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.,这事的结果是， 人们跑到商店里问: 你们有没有一款不带这么多功能的?
And do you know what the answer to this question now is?,"你想,回答会是什么？"
"The answer is ""no.""",回答是“没有”。
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.,如今你已经不可能买到一款不干 那么多事的手机。
"So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things,  the same explosion of choice is true.",同样，在生活里的其它一些比购物更 对我们产生影响事情上， 这种选择的爆炸同样存在。
"Health care. It is no longer the case in the United States  that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.",医疗保健 - 在美国，现在早已不是那种 你去看医生，医生直截了当告诉 你该如何做的时代了。
"Instead, you go to the doctor,  and the doctor tells you, ""Well, we could do A, or we could do B.",相反，你到了医生那里， 医生会对你说：我们可以用治疗方案甲， 也可以用方案乙
"A has these benefits, and these risks.",方案甲有如此这般疗效和风险。
"B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?""",方案乙有如此这般疗效和风险。 你想怎么治？
"And you say, ""Doc, what should I do?""",然后你说：“大夫，我该如何做？”
"And the doc says, ""A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks.",医生又说一遍，甲有这些疗效和风险， 乙有那些疗效和风险。
"What do you want to do?""",你想怎么治？
"And you say, ""If you were me, Doc, what would you do?""",你再问医生：“大夫，你要是我，你选那种？”
"And the doc says, ""But I'm not you.""",医生说：“但是我不是你。”
"And the result is -- we call it ""patient autonomy,""  which makes it sound like a good thing,  but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility  for decision-making from somebody who knows something --  namely, the doctor --  to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick  and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions --  namely, the patient.",其结果就是我们所说的“病人自治。” 听起来好像挺不错的。 其实是把做决定的担子和责任 从一个知道该怎么做的人 我指的是医生， 转嫁到一个对治疗方案一无所知， 而且正在为病痛所困扰， 根本不在能做决定的状态的人身上， 那人就是病人。
"There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs  to people like you and me,  which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all,  since we can't buy them.",现在那些处方药品的广告铺天盖地， 都是针对着 你我这些普通人的。 你如果仔细想想，一点也说不通。 既然我们不能直接去柜台买，
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?,他们为什么还要向我们做市场宣传？
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning  and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.,回答是，他们希望我们看了广告后 第二天早上会去给自己的医生打电话， 让医生把处方上的药换成他们的。
"Something as dramatic as our identity  has now become a matter of choice,  as this slide is meant to indicate.",如今像我们的性别身份这类的事 都成了选择的话题了。 就像这张幻灯片试图说明的那样。
We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.,现在我们的性别不是从父母那里继承下来， 而是由自己来发明。
And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.,这样我们就可以随心所欲地的 重新塑造自己的性别身份。
"And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning,  you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.",这也意味每天早上你醒来 你先得对今天你想做个什么样的人 男的还是女的做出决定。
"With respect to marriage and family,  there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had  is that you got married as soon as you could,  and then you started having kids as soon as you could.",在婚姻家庭方面， 在过去每个人到了年龄就结婚 这几乎是理所当然的事， 然后就是尽快生儿育女。
"The only real choice was who,  not when, and not what you did after.",唯一你需要选择的就是和谁结婚， 而不是什么时候结，也不是结婚以后做什么。
"Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.",而如今呢，所有的事都可以拿来挑挑拣拣。
"I teach wonderfully intelligent students,  and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.",我教的是一群优秀又聪明的学生， 可是现在我给他们布置的作业 比从前少了五分之一。
"And it's not because they're less smart,  and it's not because they're less diligent.",这不是因为他们（比以前的学生）笨， 也不是因为他们不那么勤奋。
"It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,  ""Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?",原因是他们现在脑子都装满了各种事情， 总是在问自己： 我到底该结婚还是不该结婚？ 是该现在结？
"Should I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?""",还是以后再说？我是该先要孩子， 还是先顾事业？
All of these are consuming questions.,这些都是费脑筋的问题。
"And they're going to answer these questions,  whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign  and not getting a good grade in my courses.",这些问题他们都必须回答， 不论他们是做还是不做我布置的功课， 也不论他们在我的课上拿个什么成绩。
And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer.,他们的确应该去想这些问题， 因为这都是些重要问题。
"Work -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,  with the technology that enables us  to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet --  except the Randolph Hotel.",如今做工作，像卡尔先前说的， 我们真的是有福气， 技术的进步使得我们可以 在一天的任何时间， 在地球的任一角落工作 当然这个篮道夫旅店除外。
"There is one corner, by the way,  that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.",但是，这个饭店里的确有一个地方 可以无线上网，可我不会告诉你们在哪，
I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.,不告诉你的理由是我也想用。
"So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work,  is that we have to make a decision,  again and again and again,  about whether we should or shouldn't be working.",话说回来，我们工作中的这些 难以置信的选择自由 给我们带来的就是我们必须 在选择中做出决定， 一次，一次，又一次地， 为自己现在该工作还是该休息左右摇摆。
"We can go to watch our kid play soccer,  and we have our cell phone on one hip,  and our Blackberry on our other hip,  and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.",我们去看孩子踢足球的时候 一个裤兜里装着手机， 另一个裤兜里装着黑莓， 膝上还架着笔记本电脑。
"And even if they're all shut off,  every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game,  we are also asking ourselves,  ""Should I answer this cell phone call?",即使它们都关着， 我们还是在看着孩子在场上争抢的同时 不断地问自己， 接还是不接这个电话？
"Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?""",回还是不回这个Email？ 我该不该写这封信稿？
"And even if the answer to the question is ""no,""  it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game  very different than it would've been.",即使你给自己的回答是不， 你对孩子的这场球赛的体验还是 还是大打折扣。
"So everywhere we look,  big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,  life is a matter of choice.",环顾四周， 不论大事还是小事， 物质的还是生活方式方面， 生活就是选择。
And the world we used to live in looked like this.,我们过去生活的世界是这样的。
"That is to say, there were some choices,  but not everything was a matter of choice.",就是说，选择还是有的， 但不是事事都需要选择。
And the world we now live in looks like this.,而今天我们生活的世界则是这样的。
"And the question is, is this good news, or bad news?",问题是，这到底是好事还是坏事？
"And the answer is, ""yes.""",答案是肯定的。
"We all know what's good about it,  so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.",我们都知道它的好处。 那么就让我来说说它的不好之处吧。
"All of this choice has two effects,  two negative effects on people.",所有这些选择对人们有两个影响， 而且是两个负面的影响。
"One effect, paradoxically,  is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.",其一，说起来有些自相矛盾， 就是，（选择）给我们带来的不是解放， 而是束缚，是麻痹。
"With so many options to choose from,  people find it very difficult to choose at all.",面对这么许多的选择 人们发现要做出决定非常困难。
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this:  a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.,让我给你举个非常生动的例子来说明这点， 这是一个关于对等退休金 计划投资方面做的调查。
"A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,  the gigantic mutual-fund company  of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.","我的一个同事有幸接触到 Vanguard的投资记录。 Vanguard是一家巨大的互助基金公司， 拥有约百万员工和2,000多个办公地点。"
"And what she found  is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,  rate of participation went down two percent.",她的调查发现是 当这些客户 提供的互助基金种类每增加10个 参加的人数就减少2个百分点。
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate  than if you only offer five. Why?,你提供50种基金，雇员参加的 人数比你提供5种基金时 下降百分之十。为什么呢？
"Because with 50 funds to choose from,  it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,  that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.",因为面对50种基金来选择 想要决定选那种那简直是难上加难 所以你干脆放到明天再说。
"And then tomorrow,  and tomorrow, and tomorrow,  and of course tomorrow never comes.",明日复明日， 明日何其多， 当然，明天永远也不会到来。
"Understand that not only does this mean  that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire  because they don't have enough money put away,  it also means that making the decision is so hard  that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.",我们知道这其实意味着 当人们退休时，可能只有用狗粮充饥， 因为他们没有划出足够的钱给将来， 同时，由于做决定是一件如此之难的事， 以至于连雇主给他们的那笔相当 可观的对等补助金都白白放弃了。
"By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year  from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.",不参加这种对等计划，他们每年让多达 5千元的雇主对等补贴从手边溜掉。 雇主本来是很乐于提供这种补贴的。
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.,所以，选择可能性过多的结果是麻痹僵化。
And I think it makes the world look like this.,它使得我们的世界变成这样样子
"You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?",当你进入极乐世界时， 你一定希望你做出的决定是正确的，是吗？
"You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.",在那里你一定不想再选错互助基金， 或者是沙拉调料。
"So that's one effect. The second effect  is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice,  we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice  than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.",刚才那是第一个影响。 再来说说第二个。 即使我们通过努力克服了僵化和 麻痹而终于做出了一个正确的决定， 我们对自己的做出的决定 反而不如可选性少时做出的决定更加满意。
And there are several reasons for this.,这里有几个原因。
"One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,  if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? --  it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better.",其中之一是，面对如此多的沙拉调料品种， 如果你买了一种，觉得不尽如人意， 你很容易去想象如果你挑另外一种就好了。
"And what happens  is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,  and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made,  even if it was a good decision.",结果怎么样？ 这种想象中的另外选择引得你对 你已经做出的决定感到后悔， 这种后悔心情让你对你原先做出的 选择的满意度打了折扣， 即便那其实是个很不错的选择。
"The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all  that is disappointing about the option that you chose.",选择越多，就越容易莫名其妙地 对一些事感到后悔。 这就是其一，总是不满意自己做出的 选择决定。
"Second, what economists call ""opportunity costs.""",其二，是经济学家称之为“机会成本”的东西。
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning  of talking about how much the way in which we value things  depends on what we compare them to.,今天早些时候丹。吉尔伯特讲了个大道理 就是，我们看一个东西的价值 取决于那些我们用来作比较的那些其他的东西。
"Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,  it is easy to imagine the attractive features  of alternatives that you reject  that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.",嗯，当人们有很多选择可以考虑时， 就很容易去想象那些你放弃了的选择的 吸引人的方面。 这就使得你总是对你选中了的那个觉得美中不足。
Here's an example. [I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street]  Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.,举个例子吧 不过你如果不是纽约人的话，我先道个歉
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.,但这是你此时此刻应该想的事。
Here's this couple on the Hamptons.,看看汉普顿的这两口子，
Very expensive real estate.,昂贵的富人区，
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.,华丽的海滩，阳光明媚，他们拥有这一切。
"What could be better? ""Well, damn it,"" this guy is thinking,  ""It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.",还能比这更好么？这位此时却在想“哼，真倒霉，” “现在是八月啊，” “曼哈顿的邻居们都不在家，”
"I could be parking right in front of my building.""",“我要是回去就能把车停到我自己的门前了。”
"And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea  that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.",结果整整两个星期他都被这么个想法折磨着， 天天都在念叨失去了占到那个 好停车位的机会。
"Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose,  even when what we choose is terrific.",“机会成本”总是让我们对已经做出的 决定不够满意 哪怕这个决定实际上很英明。
"And the more options there are to consider,  the more attractive features of these options  are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.",我们面临的选项越多 这些选项里吸引人的东西也就越多， 这些东西最后都成了机会成本。
Here's another example.   Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.,这又是一个例子。 这幅漫画说明了好几个问题。
"It makes points about living in the moment as well,  and probably about doing things slowly.",它也说出了“活在当下”这个道理。 也许还包括做事情要一步一步来。
"But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing,  you're choosing not to do other things  that may have lots of attractive features,  and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.",但是，其中一条道理就是，当你选择了做某件事， 你同时就选择了不做其它的事。 这些其它的事往往会有很多吸引你的地方， 并且会削弱你正在做的事对你的吸引力。
Third: escalation of expectations.,第三点，期望值增高。
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans.,这点在有一次我去买一条 新牛仔裤时对我触动很大。
I wear jeans almost all the time.,我差不多总是穿牛仔裤。
"There was a time when jeans came in one flavor,  and you bought them, and they fit like crap,  they were incredibly uncomfortable,  if you wore them and washed them enough times,  they started to feel OK.",过去，牛仔裤就那一种样式， 你买回来，裤子不合适，糟糕透顶， 而且非常不舒服， 直到你把它穿得时间足够长， 洗了无数次以后， 裤子才变得凑合。
"I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones,  and I said, ""I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size.""",就这么，穿了这许多年的旧裤子， 我终于上街去要买条新的了。 我说：“喂，我想要一条牛仔裤，这是我的尺寸。”
"And the shopkeeper said,  ""Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?",店员说： 你要紧身型的，舒适型的，还是宽松型的？
You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?,前面要扣子的还是拉锁的？石磨的还是酸洗的？
Do you want them distressed?,要那种快磨破的么？
"You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah."" On and on he went.",直口的，还是缩口的？他喋喋不休地问着。
"My jaw dropped. And after I recovered, I said,  ""I want the kind that used to be the only kind.""",我的下巴差点掉下来。等我缓过神来，我问， “我要的是那种曾经是唯一一种的样式。”
"He had no idea what that was,  so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans,  and I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.",他一头雾水， 结果我花了一个钟头试穿了 所有这些该死的牛仔裤， 最后，说实话，我带着一条 我从未有过的最合身的裤子走出店门。
I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better.,我做得的确不错。这些选择 使得我有机会做的更好。
But -- I felt worse.,但是心里感觉却更糟。
Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.,为什么？为这我还专门写了一本书 来为我自己找借口。
"The reason I felt worse is that,  with all of these options available,  my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.",让我感觉更糟糕的理由就是， 由于有了这么多的可选性， 我对于一条牛仔裤到底该有多好 才算好的期望值大大升高。
"I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.",我以前期望值很低。 当牛仔裤就那么一种时，我没有过多指望。
"When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.",当它们有一百种规格时，哼， 最好至少有一条是极致完美的。
"And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.",我那条的确不错，但是它还是不够完美。
"And so I compared what I got to what I expected,  and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.",所以我拿我已有的去和我期望的进行比较， 和我期望的比起来， 我这条就变得令人失望了。
Adding options to people's lives  can't help but increase the expectations people have  about how good those options will be.,在人们的生活里加进选择， 除了提高人们对事情到底能有多好的 期望值以外 并没有给人们带来多少好处。
"And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results,  even when they're good results.",带来的只是使人们对结果不那么满意了， 即使那是好结果。
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.,搞市场的人没有人懂得这个道理。
"Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.",因为如果他们里面有人懂的话， 你也就不会有机会知道这是什么意思了
"The truth is more like this. [Everything was better back when everything was worse]  The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse  is that when everything was worse,  it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.",事实很像这个（漫画文： 在所有东西都很糟糕的过去一切都比现在更好。）  原因在于 当一般的东西都不怎么好时 人们有可能体验到某些惊喜。
"Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens,  with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for  is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.",如今，在我们这些富裕的， 工业化的市民生活的世界里， 尽善尽美已是理所当然的， 对于每一件东西你最多也只能 希望它不比你预期的差。
"You will never be pleasantly surprised  because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof.",你再也不会被什么所惊喜， 因为你我的期望值比天还高。
The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for --  the secret to happiness is low expectations.,什么是幸福的秘密， 这是你们今天来这里想要知道的， 幸福的秘密就是：知足常乐， 不要期望过高。
"I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment --  that I actually am married to a wife,  and she's really quite wonderful.",我想抽一点时间说说自己， 我娶了我现在的太太， 她是一个很好的妻子
I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle.,这件事上我没有凑合，我尽力了。
But settling isn't always such a bad thing.,但是能凑合并不一定是坏事。
"Finally -- One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans  when there is only one kind to buy  is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why,  who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible.",最后，买一条不合身的牛仔裤的结果之一就是， 当商店里只有一种样式可以买到时， 你觉得不满意，想知道为什么， 这责任归谁？答案很明显。
What could you do?,这个世界该为此负责。 你有什么能做的么？
"When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available,  and you buy one that is disappointing,  and you ask why, who's responsible?",现如今店里有上百种牛仔裤供你选择， 你买了一条回来，觉得不满意， 这时候你问为什么，谁的责任？
"It is equally clear that the answer to the question is ""you.""",现在这个问题的答案显然就是：你。
You could have done better.,你完全可以做得更好。
"With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,  there is no excuse for failure.",那里摆着上百种牛仔裤， 你没有借口把事情搞砸。
"And so when people make decisions,  and even though the results of the decisions are good,  they feel disappointed about them;  they blame themselves.",结果是，当人们做出决定时 即使那个决定达到的结果很好 他们还是感到失望， 要责备自己。
Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.,在我们过去的这一代人里， 工业化世界中临床压抑症爆炸性增长。
"I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide,  is that people have experiences that are disappointing  because their standards are so high,  and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,  they think they're at fault.",我相信造成这种爆炸性增长的 压抑和自杀的一个重要的， 不是唯一的，但是是重要的因素 就是人们所有的那些的令人失望的经历。 原因就是他们的标准太高。 当他们必须去解释这些经历到底是怎么回事时， 他们认为这是他们自己的过错。
"And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively,  and we feel worse.",最后的净效果就是，尽管客观上 我们做得比以往好了， 但是感觉上却不如从前。
So let me remind you.,我再提醒大家，
"This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,  and it's all false. It is not true.",这个（选择带来幸福）的公认的信条， 我们都觉得是对的， 其实是错的。完全不对。
"There's no question that some choice is better than none,  but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.",毫无疑问有选择比没选择要好， 但是不能就此推论选择越多越好。
There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.,这里有一个关键值，我不知道是多少。
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point  where options improve our welfare.,但是我可以肯定我们早就远远超出了 ‘选择令我们富有’ 所需要的这个关键值了。
"Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done --  as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:  what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence.",我快说完了。现在说说一个政策问题， 我们该想想的一个政策问题是， 给我们这个工业化社会带来这么多选择的， 是物质的极大丰富。
"There are lots of places in the world,  and we have heard about several of them,  where their problem is not that they have too much choice.",我们这个世界上还有很多地方， 至少我们听说过其中几个， 在那里问题不是选择太多，
Their problem is that they have too little.,而是几乎没有。
"So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies.",所以我在这里谈的这个话题是现代富裕的西方社会的
And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this:  Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday  about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help.,一个特殊问题。 史蒂夫。里维特昨天就说过， 令人气愤的问题是，我们生产的那些 昂贵而又难以操作的婴儿汽车座椅 于事无补，只是在浪费钱。
"What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices --  it's not simply that they don't help.",而我今天要说的就是这些昂贵的，复杂的选择 不仅仅是于事无补，
They actually hurt.,它们其实在给我们带来伤害。
They actually make us worse off.,它们其实让我们变得不如从前。
"If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make  were shifted to societies in which people have too few options,  not only would those people's lives be improved,  but ours would be improved also,  which is what economists call a ""Pareto-improving move.""",如果我们把给这个社会创造出 这些选择的人力物力拿出一部分来 投入到那些现在人们还没有足够选择的社会中去， 那么不仅那里人们的生活可以得到改善， 我们自己的生活质量也同样得到提高。 这就是经济学家称之为的帕累托改善的做法。
"Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people --  because of how all this excess choice plagues us. So to conclude. [You can be anything you want to be -- no limits]  You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say,  ""Ah! What does this fish know?",产品的再分配会使得所有人， 不仅仅是穷人，的生活好起来， 因为我们摆脱了那些像瘟疫般困扰 我们的多余的选择 结束之前，你们该看看这幅漫画， 并站在一个智者的立场说， “哼，这条鱼懂什么？
"You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl.""",告诉你，在这个鱼缸里一切都是不可能的。”
"Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world --  and that's the way I read it at first.",毫无想象力，目光短浅- 我第一次看到这幅画时是这么解读的。
"The more I thought about it, however,  the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.",可是，我越想越明显地感到 这鱼肯定知道些什么。
"Because the truth of the matter  is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible,  you don't have freedom. You have paralysis.",因为说实话 如果你想让一切都变得有可能而把鱼缸打破， 你得到的不是自由，而是瘫痪（鱼会死）。
"If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible,  you decrease satisfaction.",如果你想让一切都变得有可能而把鱼缸打破， 你反而降低了满意度。
"You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.",你增加了的是瘫痪，减少了的是满足。
Everybody needs a fishbowl.,每个人都需要这么个“鱼缸”。
"This one is almost certainly too limited --  perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.",至于这个（鱼缸）嘛，对这条鱼 可能是小了点，对于我们几乎肯定是太小了。
"But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery,  and, I suspect, disaster.",但是，没有这么个象征性的鱼缸那就 意味着苦难将至， 也许是，灾难。
Thank you very much.,非常感谢。
